# uhppote-cli

CLI for the *UHPPOTE UT0311-L0x* TCP/IP Wiegand access control boards. 

Supported operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- Raspberry Pi (ARM7)

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The CLI provides a cross-platform set of command-line functions that allow direct interaction with a UHPPOTE access controller,
as well as facilitating scripting for automation of routine tasks e.g. synchronizing controller system time across daylight 
savings changes.

## Installation

An archive containing executables for all the supported operating systems can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli/releases) page. Alternatively, operating system specific tarballs can be found in the [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/releases) releases.

Installation is straightforward - download the archive and extract it to a directory of your choice and place the executable in a directory in your PATH. 

### `uhppoted.conf`

By default, `uhppote-cli` uses the communal `uhppoted.conf` configuration file shared by all the `uhppoted` project modules which is (_or will eventually be_) documented in [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted). 

A valid configuration file is required **only** for system configurations where controllers are not findable on the local LAN (i.e. cannot receive and reply to UDP broadcasts) or for use with the _ACL_ commands which do require a valid `uhppoted.conf` to resolve the door ID to controller + door number. For _device_ commands the configuration file will used if present otherwise the internal default configuration will be used.

An alternative configuration file can be specified with the `--config` command line option, e.g.:

```
uhppote-cli --config ./uhppote.mine get-device 4726234734
```

A sample [uhppoted.conf](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/blob/master/runtime/simulation/405419896.conf) file is included in the `uhppoted` distribution.

### Building from source

Assuming you have `Go` and `make` installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli.git
cd uhppote-cli
make build
```

If you prefer not to use `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli.git
cd uhppote-cli
mkdir bin
go build -trimpath -o bin ./...
```

The above commands build the `uhppote-cli` executable to the `bin` directory.

  405419896 8165538 true
```
**NOTES**
1. For a door associated with a time profile, `uhppote-cli` requires the time profile to be an existing time profile defined in the controller. The controller itself does not enforce this requirement but linking to a non-existent time profile counter-intuitively seems to allow access at any time of day.

  405419896: time profile 29 created
```
**NOTES**
1. `uhppote-cli` requires the linked profile to be an existing time profile defined in the controller. The controller itself does not enforce this requirement but linking to a non-existent time profile counter-intuitively seems to allow access at any time of day.
2. `uhppote-cli` does not allow a time profile to define a link that creates a circular chain of time profiles. Again, the controller itself does not enforce this requirement but is indicative of a mistake in the definition of the time profiles.

#### `clear-time-profiles`

Deletes all time profiles from a controller.

```
uhppote-cli [options] clear-time-profiles <device ID>

  --listen      Overrides the default (or configured) listen IP address on which to listen for events
  --timeout     Sets the timeout for a response from a controller (default value is 2.5s)
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the UHPPOTE controllers

  Example:

  uhppote-cli clear-time-profiles 405419896
  405419896 true
```
**NOTES**
1. Clearing all time profiles will allow access at any time of day to cards that were previously _time managed_. In general this command is intended to be used when redefining all the time profiles.

#### `get-time-profiles`

#### `set-time-profiles`

Creates (or updates) time profiles on a controller from a TSV file. 

Invalid time profiles (e.g. with missing or otherwise invalid _from_ and _to_ dates or invalid segments) are ignored with a warning. Likewise, time profiles that link to an undefined time profile or time profiles with a linked profile that would create a circular chain are ignored with a warning. 
```

  ./bin/uhppote-cli set-time-profiles 405419896 405419896.tsv
   ... set time profile 3
   ... set time profile 29
   ... set time profile 105
   ... set time profile 2

   WARN  profile 51  - linked time profile 50 is not defined
   WARN  profile 75  - linking to time profile 75 creates a circular reference [75 75]
   WARN  profile 150 - 'To' date (2021-04-01) is before 'From' date (2021-12-31)
   WARN  profile 151 - segment 1 'End' (09:31) is before 'Start' (11:31)  
```
**NOTES** 
1. `set-time-profiles` does not clear existing time profiles from the controller i.e. although not recommended, profiles in the file can link to individually defined existing profiles.
2. There is no requirement for the profiles to be in any particular order e.g. `uhppote-cli` is capable of creating a time profile that is linked to a profile that is defined after it in the TSV file.

### ACL commands

The ACL (_access control list_) commands manage access permissions across the set of _UHPPOTE_ controllers configured in the `conf` file. The following commands are supported:

- `grant`
- `revoke`
- `show`
- `load-acl`
- `get-acl`
- `compare-acl`

### ACL file format

The only currently supported ACL file format is TSV (tab separated values) and is expected to be formatted as follows:

    Card Number From  To  Workshop  Side Door Front Door  Garage  Upstairs  Downstairs  Tower Cellar
    123465537 2020-01-01  2020-12-31  N N Y N Y N Y Y
    231465538 2020-01-01  2020-12-31  Y N Y N N 29 N N
    635465539 2020-01-01  2020-12-31  N N N N Y N Y Y

| Field         | Description                                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Card Number` | Access card number                                                         |
| `From`        | Date from which card is valid (_valid from 00:00 on that date_)            |
| `To`          | Date until which card is valid (_valid until 23:59 on that date_)          |
| `<door>`      | Door name matching controller configuration (_case and space insensitive_) |
| `<door>`      | ...                                                                        |
| ...           |                                                                            |

The ACL file must include a column for each controller + door configured in the _devices_ section of the `uhppoted.conf` file used to configure the utility. Permissions for a door can be:
- Y
- N
- time profile ID (e.g. 29)

An [example ACL file](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/blob/master/runtime/simulation/405419896.acl) is included in the full `uhppoted` distribution, along with the matching [_conf_](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/blob/master/runtime/simulation/405419896.conf) file.

#### `grant`

Grants access permissions to a single card across the set of configured UHPPOTE controllers. The `grant` command extends
the functionality of the device `put-card` command to set the access permissions across multiple controllers using door 
names rather than the device specific controller + door ID's. The _granted_ permissions are added to the existing card
access permissions.

*NOTE: The date range during which a card has access is automatically widened to accommodate the earliest _from_ date and latest
_to_ date across the controllers.*

```
uhppote-cli [options] grant <card> <from> <to> [doors]

  <card>        Card number to be granted access
  <from>        Date from which the card is granted access, in yyyy-mm-dd format. Access is 
                granted from 00:00 on the 'from' date.
  <to>          Date until which the card is granted access, , in yyyy-mm-dd format. Access
                is granted until 23:59 on the 'to' date.

  Options: 
  --config      Sets the uhppoted.conf file to use for controller configurations
  --bind        Overrides the default (or configured) bind IP address for a command
  --broadcast   Overrides the default (or configured) broadcast IP address to which to send a command
  --listen      Overrides the default (or configured) listen IP address on which to listen for events
  --timeout     Sets the timeout for a response from a controller (default value is 2.5s)
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the UHPPOTE controllers

  Example:

  uhppote-cli grant 918273645 2020-01-01 2020-12-31 Front Door, Workshop

```

#### `revoke`

Revokes access permissions for a single card across the set of configured UHPPOTE controllers. The `revoke` command 
extends the functionality of the device `put-card` command to revoke the access permissions across multiple controllers 
using door names rather than the device specific controller + door ID's. The _revoked_ permissions are removed from the 
existing card access permissions.

```
  uhppote-cli [options] revoke <card> [doors]

  <card>        Card number to be granted access

  Options: 
  --config      Sets the uhppoted.conf file to use for controller configurations

  --broadcast   Overrides the default (or configured) broadcast IP address to which to send a command
  --listen      Overrides the default (or configured) listen IP address on which to listen for events
  --timeout     Sets the timeout for a response from a controller (default value is 2.5s)
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the UHPPOTE controllers

  Example:

  uhppote-cli revoke 918273645 Garage

```

#### `show`

Retrieves and displays the access permissions for a single card across the set of configured UHPPOTE controllers. 

```
   uhppote-cli [options] show <card>

  --listen      Overrides the default (or configured) listen IP address on which to listen for events
  --timeout     Sets the timeout for a response from a controller (default value is 2.5s)
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the UHPPOTE controllers

  Example:

  uhppote-cli show 918273645

```

#### `load-acl`

Loads the access permissions from an ACL file to the set of configured UHPPOTE controllers. A sample [ACL](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/blob/master/runtime/simulation/405419896.acl) file is included in the full 
`uhppoted` distribution.

```
   uhppote-cli [options] load-acl <ACL file>

```

### `get-acl`

Fetches the cards stored in the set of configured UHPPOTE controllers, creates a matching ACL file from the UHPPOTED controller configuration and writes it to a TSV file. 

```
  uhppote-cli [options] get-acl <file>

  Options: 
  --config      Sets the uhppoted.conf file to use for controller configurations
