## Installation

Executables for all the supported operating systems are packaged in the [releases](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli/releases). The provided archives contain the executables for all the operating systems - operating system specific tarballs can be found in the [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/releases) releases.

Installation is straightforward - download the archive and extract it to a directory of your choice and place the executable in a directory in your PATH. 

### `uhppoted.conf`

By default, `uhppote-cli` uses the communal `uhppoted.conf` configuration file shared by all the `uhppoted` project modules which is (or will eventually be) documented in [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted). 

A valid configuration file is required **only** for system configurations where controllers are not findable on the local LAN (i.e. cannot receive and reply to UDP broadcasts) or for use with the _ACL_ commands which require a valid `uhppoted.conf` to resolve the door ID to controller + door number. For _device_ commands the configuration file will used if present otherwise the internal default configuration will be used.

An alternative configuration file can be specified with the `--config` command line option, e.g.:

```
uhppote-cli --config ./uhppote.mine get-device 4726234734
```

A sample [uhppoted.conf](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/blob/master/runtime/simulation/405419896.conf) file is included in the `uhppoted` distribution.

### Building from source

Assuming you have `Go` and `make` installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli.git
cd uhppote-cli
make build
```

If you prefer not to use `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppote-cli.git
cd uhppote-cli
mkdir bin
go build -o bin ./...
```

The above commands build the `uhppote-cli` executable to the `bin` directory.

### ACL commands

The ACL (_access control list_) commands manage access permissions across the set of _UHPPOTE_ controllers configured in the `conf` file. The following commands are supported:

- `grant`
- `revoke`
- `show`
- `load-acl`
- `get-acl`
- `compare-acl`

### ACL file format

The only currently supported ACL file format is TSV (tab separated values) and is expected to be formatted as follows:

    Card Number From  To  Workshop  Side Door Front Door  Garage  Upstairs  Downstairs  Tower Cellar
    123465537 2020-01-01  2020-12-31  N N Y N Y N Y Y
    231465538 2020-01-01  2020-12-31  Y N Y N N Y N N
    635465539 2020-01-01  2020-12-31  N N N N Y N Y Y

| Field         | Description                                                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Card Number` | Access card number                                                         |
| `From`        | Date from which card is valid (_valid from 00:00 on that date_)            |
| `To`          | Date until which card is valid (_valid until 23:59 on that date_)          |
| `<door>`      | Door name matching controller configuration (_case and space insensitive_) |
| `<door>`      | ...                                                                        |
| ...           |                                                                            |

The ACL file must include a column for each controller + door configured in the _devices_ section of the `uhppoted.conf` file used to configure the utility.

An [example ACL file](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/blob/master/runtime/simulation/405419896.acl) is included in the full `uhppoted` distribution, along with the matching [_conf_](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/blob/master/runtime/simulation/405419896.conf) file.

#### `grant`

Grants access permissions to a single card across the set of configured UHPPOTE controllers. The `grant` command extends
the functionality of the device `put-card` command to set the access permissions across multiple controllers using door 
names rather than the device specific controller + door ID's. The _granted_ permissions are added to the existing card
access permissions.

*NOTE: The date range during which a card has access is automatically widened to accommodate the earliest _from_ date and latest
_to_ date across the controllers.*

```
uhppote-cli [options] grant <card> <from> <to> [doors]

  <card>        Card number to be granted access
  <from>        Date from which the card is granted access, in yyyy-mm-dd format. Access is 
                granted from 00:00 on the 'from' date.
  <to>          Date until which the card is granted access, , in yyyy-mm-dd format. Access
                is granted until 23:59 on the 'to' date.

  Options: 

  --config      Sets the uhppoted.conf file to use for controller configurations
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the UHPPOTE controllers

  Example:

  uhppote-cli grant 918273645 2020-01-01 2020-12-31 Front Door, Workshop

```

#### `revoke`

Revokes access permissions for a single card across the set of configured UHPPOTE controllers. The `revoke` command 
extends the functionality of the device `put-card` command to revoke the access permissions across multiple controllers 
using door names rather than the device specific controller + door ID's. The _revoked_ permissions are removed from the 
existing card access permissions.

```
  uhppote-cli [options] revoke <card> [doors]
